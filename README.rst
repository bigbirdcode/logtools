Goal
----

Log viewer application that displays separate runs from a log file
in separate tabs and enable fast searching pre-defined patterns.

Concept
-------

There are many great log viewer out. But I wanted to write mine.
The main difference that I don't really know in advance what I'm
looking for in the logs. I know some patterns, and then I just
want jump back and forth through them and looking for anomalies.
When I find something else to search then I record a new pattern.

I also want to see some blocks of log at once. So one run of
the logger application or one processing block or so. All these
will go to their own tab, quickly showing me how many blocks do
the log have.

Finally I would like to see some statistics about my logs and
patterns.

Status
------

All the above things are done at a very basic level. It is already
usable, but really limited. Also design is a bit raw, need some
refactor iteration.
I would like to continue and enhance since I
need it and I have much more idea, how to go on.
